// Introduction to Trees
// A Tree is a hierarchical data structure that is different from linear data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. A subtree is a part of the tree below any chosen node that can be considered as a separate tree with that node as a root node. Subtree is very much similar to the sub-directory which lies inside of a root directory as in our computer systems.


// A Binary Tree is a type of tree in which each node cannot have more than 2 children nodes. These types of trees are very important and are used extensively.
// The root node of a Binary Tree is the top-most node from where the tree hierarchy begins.
// Leaf nodes are those nodes that lie at the terminal part of the tree indicating the last or bottom-most part of the tree.
// Children of a node are the nodes to which the pointers from the node directly point. These nodes lie directly below or in the next hierarchical level of the chosen node.
// The ancestors of a given node are all the nodes that come before the node while traversing from the root node to the given node.
// There are different types of Binary Trees:

// Full Binary Tree – It is a type of tree in which each node has either 0 or 2 children.

// 2. Complete Binary Tree – It is a type of tree where all the levels of the tree are filled with nodes except the last level. The last level must have each node as left as possible.


// 3. Perfect Binary Tree – It is a type of tree in which all the leaf nodes should be on the same level.


// 4. Balanced Binary Tree – In a balanced binary tree, the height of the tree should be at max log(N), where N is the number of nodes. The tree should not be skewed.


// 5. Degenerate Tree – A degenerate tree is a skewed tree that is similar to a linked list where each node is connected to the left of the previous node and the tree goes leftwards only.

// Say, for N = 4, the degenerate tree would look like this:
